Each module will have an assignment associated that could be a simple quiz, a reflection piece or solving a LP model in R, Python or Excel. The readings associated with each module will be posted on Sakai. \\noi{The proposed schedule below is subject to change. My initial plan is to cover all the material listed here but I might modify it if extra time is needed for some particular topics. I will provide updates via Sakai or Slack.

%Note that we may {\bf not} have classes during energy week if there is a session or panel related to the topics discussed in class. If that's the case, you are supposed to attend the session in lieu of the class. And you are expected to write about it in your journal.}
