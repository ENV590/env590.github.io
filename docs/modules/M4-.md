## Learning Objectives

In this module we will shift the discuss to electricity generation. The learning outcomes of this module are:

* Understanding the definition and characteristics of distributed generation;
* Learning the main differences between conventional and renewable generation;
* Learning the state of art of renewable resources deployment in the U.S. and world wide;
* Understanding the challenges of renewable energy integration to the power grid;
* Exploring possible solutions for renewable resources intermittency;
* Explore a case study on behind-the-meter (BTM) electricity generation.

## Slides

Here is a <a href="/docs/modules/PPTS/PSE_M3_P1_SmartGrids_Generation.pdf" > link </a> to the slide deck used in class on the first part on how electricity generation will change. And here is another <a href="/docs/modules/PPTS/PSE_M3_P2_DistributedGeneration.pdf" > deck </a> on distributed generation.

## Topics for Discussion/Reflection

* How do we deal with renewable energy source intermittency? <br>
* Where do you think DG would have the greatest advantage? <br>
* What do you see as the biggest obstacle to DG? How could it be overcome? <br>


## Deliverables

For this module you will complete [Assignment 1](https://sakai.duke.edu/portal/site/fc198b90-9d77-4c6b-8708-c9d0d044be5b/tool/bf736605-42a0-41a8-987a-754e3066d785?panel=Main). The due date for A1 is Friday Sept 23rd.
